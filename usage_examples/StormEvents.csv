The debris flow continued into the early morning hours of December 1. Mud, water, and debris rushed down Amago Creek and caused serious damage to several vehicles, a house, and portions of highway 76. The force of the debris flow was strong enough to wash away a series of K-rails that had recently been installed to protect a home in case of such an event. Two-inch diameter pins used to secure the K-rails were sheered off at the ground and the house was buried in mud. The wall of water that rushed down Amago Creek was estimated to be 15 feet high and 150 to 200 feet wide. In addition to mud and rocks, the flash flood also carried with it large trees that had burned just one month earlier during the Poomacha Fire. The District 11 Mountain Area Superintendent of the DOT witnessed the event and said all of Highway 76 from Valley Center Road to South Grade Road was impacted by several flash floods and debris flows. His vehicle was damaged by the flash flood at Amago Creek when it was struck by a tree and other debris. Please note that damage estimates are not included for this event as they have already been accounted for in the orignal November storm data entry.","","{""TotalDamages"":0,""StartTime"":""2007-12-01T00:00:00.0000000Z"",""EndTime"":""2007-12-01T01:00:00.0000000Z"",""Details"":{""Description"":"""",""Location"":""CALIFORNIA""}}"

A powerful upper low moved onto the west coast during the middle of the week, and advanced east through the Rockies during the end of the week.  Strong warm air advection took place over the top of a shallow polar airmass that was in place over Iowa.  The east-southeasterly flow at the surface drew cool and dry air into the state from the east, setting the stage for a significant ice storm.  The main area of precipitation overspread the state during the early morning hours of the 24th and persisted through much of the 25th.  Initially, very warm air aloft meant that the precipitation fell in the form of freezing rain and sleet.  The central and northeast sections of the CWA were most effected with the ice as the southwest warmed to just above freezing.  Ice accumulations ranged from around one quarter of an inch or so along a Carroll to Centerville line, to between one half and on inch over the northeast part of the CWA in the Waterloo, Tama, Marshalltown, to south of Mason City areas.  Widespread tree and power line damage was reported across much of the northeast two thirds of the CWA.  Reports of 345 KV lines down were received from Tama and Black Hawk Couties.  During this time, easterly winds were blowing in the 20 to 40 MPH range, exacerbating the problem.  Tama County reported 75 miles of power lines down.  Butler County reported at least 250 power poles snapped already by the evening of the 24th.  At the height of the storm, at least 265,000 customers were without power.  Interstate Power and Light Company reported that 1000 miles of transmission line was down at one point and 2000 utility poles were snapped in their area covered by Alliant Energy.  MidAmerica Energy reported 360 miles of transmission line down and 1600 utility poles snapped in their area.  Final damage figures for the three utility entities involved in the ice storm were $70,000,000 damage to Alliant Energy equipment, $36,000,000 damage to MidAmerica Energy equipment, and $32,000,000 damage to Rural Electric Cooperative equipment.  These figures are statewide figures and therefore were not entirely within the Des Moines CWA.  The freezing rain changed over to sleet, and eventually snow late on the 24th into the 25th.  Six to twelve inches of snow was common across much of Iowa northwest of a Bedford, to Des Moines, to Grundy Center line.  Some of the heavier amounts include 11.5 inches at Algona in Kossuth County, and 10 inches at Dana in Greene County and Estherville in Emmet County.  Along with the snow, many areas reported occasional visibility near zero in blowing snow on the night of the 24th into the 25th.  Travel became very hazardous with many roads closed due to the combination of snow, blowing snow, fallen wires, and fallen trees.  Numerous activities were canceled on the 25th as well.  By the afternoon of the 25th, Iowa Governor Chet Culver had already given 60 counties the state disaster declaration by the afternoon following the storm.  Subsequently, 46 of the counties, mostly in northeast Iowa, received a Presidential Disaster Declaration.  Some of the hardest hit areas were in Poweshiek, Marshall, Tama, and Black Hawk Counties. Costs in the city of Waterloo, for example, were over $2,000,000 during the first week after the storm. This winter storm went into the books as one of the worst winter storms in many years.  Although ice storms are not documented all that well, this storm appears to be the worst ice storm in Iowa in the past 40 years due to the large areal extent of the storm.  Farther to the south and west the precipitation fell as rain.  Enough rain fell to cause some minor flooding on the Chariton and Middle Rivers.  The Middle River crested about a foot over flood state in Indianola, while the Chariton River crested a little over 2 feet over flood stage in Chariton.","","{""TotalDamages"":5000,""StartTime"":""2007-02-24T23:00:00.0000000Z"",""EndTime"":""2007-02-26T22:00:00.0000000Z"",""Details"":{""Description"":"""",""Location"":""IOWA""}}"

A lull in the rain occurred late on the 12th and into the night.  A low pressure wave then moved along the frontal zone, bringing back the rain during the predawn hours on the 13th.  South of the front, inflow dew points were on the order of 55 to 60 degrees in the upper Tennessee River Valley. The low pressure wave crossed west to east, from near Huntington to Elkins, during the morning hours of the 13th.  Rain rates increased at dawn in the Parkersburg to Clarksburg corridor.  The Clarksburg airport measured 0.38 in one hour ending at 0700E, then 0.59 in the hour ending near 0800E.  A half inch of rain was measured at Clarksburg between 0800E and 1000E, followed by nearly another half inch between 1000E and 1200E.  The rain diminished in the early afternoon. ||All total, the Clarksburg airport measured 2.55 inches of rain in an 18 hour period.  Over the course of two days, the cooperative observer at Clarksburg reported a total of 3.1 inches, while West Union had 3.04 inches, Harrisville had 2.55 inches, Middlebourne 1.97 inches.  An unofficial spotter reported 2.9 inches at Salem of Harrison County. ||Flash flooding of small streams was widespread across Pleasants, Tyler, Ritchie, Doddridge, Harrison, and Lewis Counties.  A few of the streams were Middle Island Creek, Ten Mile Creek, Little Ten Mile Creek, Lost Creek, and the numerous streams feeding into the North Fork of the Hughes River. Most of the problems were flooded roads and bridges, that lead to limited access.  Damage to some culverts were reported. Limited evacuations and damage to dwellings did occur. In Harrison County, 7 businesses in Salem had water in them, ranging from 6 inches to 2.5 feet.  The old City Hall had 2.5 feet of water.  In the aftermath of the flooding, the city of Salem was moving its city hall to a less flood prone dwelling.  The Salem fire department had 1.5 feet of water inside.  Those waters were along Salem Fork that flows into Ten Mile Creek.  Three mobile homes in Harrison County were reported damaged.||The widespread flash flooding led to minor river flooding along the West Fork and Little Kanawha Rivers later on the 13th and into the 14th.  The high water on these rivers kept some roads flooded and closed. The crest at Clarksburg on the West Fork River was 15.6 feet around 2300E on the 13th.  Flood stage is 14 feet.  At Glenville, the crest was 24.2 feet around 0000E on the 14th.  Flood stage at Glenville is 23 feet.","","{""TotalDamages"":200000,""StartTime"":""2007-12-13T08:55:00.0000000Z"",""EndTime"":""2007-12-13T12:30:00.0000000Z"",""Details"":{""Description"":"""",""Location"":""WEST VIRGINIA""}}"

South of the front, inflow dew points were on the order of 55 to 60 degrees in the upper Tennessee River Valley. The low pressure wave crossed west to east, from near Huntington to Elkins, during the morning hours of the 13th.  Rain rates increased at dawn in the Parkersburg to Clarksburg corridor.  The Clarksburg airport measured 0.38 in one hour ending at 0700E, then 0.59 in the hour ending near 0800E.  A half inch of rain was measured at Clarksburg between 0800E and 1000E, followed by nearly another half inch between 1000E and 1200E.

A large and powerful storm system took shape as a deep surface low tracked across Kansas and into portions of Iowa. This strong area of low pressure was driven by a powerful upper level trough which supported very strong winds through the entire atmosphere. These winds were felt at the surface to some degree as a large area across the Lower Mississippi River Valley saw sustained winds between 25-35 mph with gusts between 40-50 mph. Those gradient winds, in advance of the severe weather, were strong enough to down some trees and power lines across the region. Those damage reports were more scattered in nature.|Those strong winds from the deepening surface low helped to draw northward moisture and instability. The strong winds allowed for the environment to become highly sheared. Basically, there were increasing winds with height and a change in the wind direction as well. This particular combination of instability and high shear was quite rare. However, this set the stage for a severe weather outbreak which included numerous reports of damaging winds, large hail and a few tornadoes.","","{""TotalDamages"":0,""StartTime"":""2007-02-24T22:24:00.0000000Z"",""EndTime"":""2007-02-24T22:35:00.0000000Z"",""Details"":{""Description"":"""",""Location"":""MISSISSIPPI""}}"

A wedge of cool air was intensifying across north central and northeast Georgia, with the front marking this wedge of cooler air lying across central and southeast Georgia.  Meanwhile, deep coastal low development along the mid-Atlantic coast was underway as the upper trough rotated into the southeast states.  The combination of these strong dynamics, a strong low-level jet, and unseasonably warm, moist air across southeast Georgia in advance of the front and upper disturbance resulted in the development of thunderstorms across south Georgia.

A lull in the rain occurred late on the 12th and into the night.  A low pressure wave then moved along the frontal zone, bringing back the rain during the predawn hours on the 13th.  South of the front, inflow dew points were on the order of 55 to 60 degrees in the upper Tennessee River Valley. The low pressure wave crossed west to east, from near Huntington to Elkins, during the morning hours of the 13th.  Rain rates increased at dawn in the Parkersburg to Clarksburg corridor.  The Clarksburg airport measured 0.38 in one hour ending at 0700E, then 0.59 in the hour ending near 0800E.  A half inch of rain was measured at Clarksburg between 0800E and 1000E, followed by nearly another half inch between 1000E and 1200E.

A lull in the rain occurred late on the 12th and into the night.  A low pressure wave then moved along the frontal zone, bringing back the rain during the predawn hours on the 13th.  South of the front, inflow dew points were on the order of 55 to 60 degrees in the upper Tennessee River Valley.

Unseasonably warm conditions had prevailed across this region of the country throughout the preceding days, while much colder weather and significant winter weather prevailed to the northwest across the southern plains and midwest.  A wedge of cool air was intensifying across north central and northeast Georgia, with the front marking this wedge of cooler air lying across central and southeast Georgia.  Meanwhile, deep coastal low development along the mid-Atlantic coast was underway as the upper trough rotated into the southeast states.  The combination of these strong dynamics, a strong low-level jet, and unseasonably warm, moist air across southeast Georgia in advance of the front and upper disturbance resulted in the development of thunderstorms across south Georgia.  As the storms moved northeast and encountered the wedge front, they quickly became rotating supercells spawning three tornadoes in a one-hour period across the southeast portion of the Peachtree City, Georgia Weather Forecast Office County Warning Area.","A survey conducted by the National Weather Service Forecast Office in Peachtree City, GA concluded that a tornado touched down approximately two miles west of Owensboro in southeast Wilcox county.

The low pressure wave crossed west to east, from near Huntington to Elkins, during the morning hours of the 13th.  Rain rates increased at dawn in the Parkersburg to Clarksburg corridor.  The Clarksburg airport measured 0.38 in one hour ending at 0700E, then 0.59 in the hour ending near 0800E.  A half inch of rain was measured at Clarksburg between 0800E and 1000E, followed by nearly another half inch between 1000E and 1200E.

Most of the problems were flooded roads and bridges, that lead to limited access.  Damage to some culverts were reported. Limited evacuations and damage to dwellings did occur. In Harrison County, 7 businesses in Salem had water in them, ranging from 6 inches to 2.5 feet.  The old City Hall had 2.5 feet of water.  In the aftermath of the flooding, the city of Salem was moving its city hall to a less flood prone dwelling.  The Salem fire department had 1.5 feet of water inside.

A large and powerful storm system took shape as a deep surface low tracked across Kansas and into portions of Iowa. This strong area of low pressure was driven by a powerful upper level trough which supported very strong winds through the entire atmosphere. These winds were felt at the surface to some degree as a large area across the Lower Mississippi River Valley saw sustained winds between 25-35 mph with gusts between 40-50 mph. Those gradient winds, in advance of the severe weather, were strong enough to down some trees and power lines across the region. Those damage reports were more scattered in nature.|Those strong winds from the deepening surface low helped to draw northward moisture and instability. The strong winds allowed for the environment to become highly sheared. Basically, there were increasing winds with height and a change in the wind direction as well. This particular combination of instability and high shear was quite rare.

The morning convection moved off allowing for afternoon solar isolation to take place, destabilizing the atmosphere once again.  Temperatures over the southwest half of the state warmed into the mid to upper 80s with dew points in the low to mid 70s.  West of Iowa it warmed into the mid 90s with mid 70 dew points.  The airmass became very unstable with CAPE in the the 5000 to 8000 J/kg range from western Iowa west.  Lifted indices fell into the -10 to -14 C. range by late afternoon.  A considerable amount of shear remained in place with 40 to 55 kts present at the time of thunderstorm development.  The LCL was reasonably high however at 1000 to 1500 meters.  Thunderstorms developed in to a linear complex that showed a few bow echo elements along the leading edge.  The main weather features with this system were high winds and hail.  The available downdraft CAPE was between 1200 and 1500 J/kg and was favorable for high winds.  There was 600 to 900 J/kg of available CAPE in the -10 to -30 C. layer of the atmosphere.  In spite of the high values, hail size was limited by the high freezing levels, between 14,500 feet to over 15,500 feet.  As the storms moved into the western part of the CWA, winds were the strongest.  Reports of winds between 60  and 70 MPH were common along the leading edge of the line.  The winds diminished as the storms moved east.  Hail reports were spotty with this event.  The hail was relatively small with most of it in the three quarter to one inch diameter range.  The storms produced heavy rainfall once again with 1.6 to 1.8 inches of precipitable water available.  The heavy rain fell in areas that were affected by the past several days of rain.  Calhoun and Webster had some flash flooding, but it was relatively minor and limited to road closures caused by water flowing over the roads.","","{""TotalDamages"":15000,""StartTime"":""2007-08-20T19:55:00.0000000Z"",""EndTime"":""2007-08-20T19:55:00.0000000Z"",""Details"":{""Description"":"""",""Location"":""IOWA""}}"

A large and powerful storm system took shape as a deep surface low tracked across Kansas and into portions of Iowa. This strong area of low pressure was driven by a powerful upper level trough which supported very strong winds through the entire atmosphere. These winds were felt at the surface to some degree as a large area across the Lower Mississippi River Valley saw sustained winds between 25-35 mph with gusts between 40-50 mph. Those gradient winds, in advance of the severe weather, were strong enough to down some trees and power lines across the region. Those damage reports were more scattered in nature.|Those strong winds from the deepening surface low helped to draw northward moisture and instability. The strong winds allowed for the environment to become highly sheared. Basically, there were increasing winds with height and a change in the wind direction as well. This particular combination of instability and high shear was quite rare. However, this set the stage for a severe weather outbreak which included numerous reports of damaging winds, large hail and a few tornadoes.","Scattered trees blown down across the county.","{""TotalDamages"":40000,""StartTime"":""2007-02-24T18:45:00.0000000Z"",""EndTime"":""2007-02-24T19:05:00.0000000Z"",""Details"":{""Description"":""Scattered trees blown down across the county."",""Location"":""MISSISSIPPI""}}"
